<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Pourceaugnac', acted on October 6, 1669, is nothing but
a farce. But Moli&egrave;re excels in farce as well as in higher comedy, and
'Monsieur de Pourceaugnac' is one of the best of its kind. The
attacks upon the doctors of the time are not exaggerated. Moli&egrave;re
acted the part of Mr. de Pourceaugnac.</p>

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;&mdash;JULIA, &Eacute;RASTE, N&Eacute;RINE.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Oh dear, &Eacute;raste! take care that we are not discovered. I am so
afraid of being seen with you; all would be lost after the command I
have received to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
I see nobody about.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">N&eacute;rine</span>).
Just keep watch, N&eacute;rine, and be careful that
nobody comes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
(<i>going to the farther end of the stage</i>). Trust me for that: and
say all you have to say to each other.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Have you thought of anything to favour our plan, &Eacute;raste? And do
you think that we shall succeed in breaking off that marriage which my
father has taken into his head?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
We are at least doing all we can for it, and we have ready many
schemes to bring such an absurd notion to naught.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
(<i>running towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julia</span>).
I say, here is your father.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Ah! let us separate quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
No, no; don't go; I made a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
How absurd you are, N&eacute;rine, to give us such a fright!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Yes, dear Julia, we have plenty of stratagems ready for the
purpose; and, in accordance with the permission you have given me, we
will not hesitate to make use of every means. Do not ask me what it is
we are going to do; you will have the fun of seeing it, and, as at a
comedy, it will be nice for you to have the pleasure of being
surprised without my letting you know beforehand what is going to take
place. This is telling you that we have many schemes in hand for the
occasion, and that our clever N&eacute;rine and the dexterous Sbrigani have
undertaken to bring the affair to a successful issue.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
Yes, we have indeed. Is your father crazy to think of entangling
you with his lawyer of Limoges; that Mr. de Pourceaugnac, whom he has
never seen in his life, and who comes by the coach to take you away
before our very eyes? Ought three or four thousand crowns, more or
less&mdash;and that, too, upon the word of your uncle&mdash;to make him refuse a
lover you like? Besides, are you made for a Limousin? If he has taken
it into his head to marry, why does he not take one of his own
countrywomen, and let Christians be at peace? The very name of
Pourceaugnac puts me in a frightful rage. I boil over with Mr. de
Pourceaugnac. If it were only because of the name, I would do anything
to prevent the match. No, you shall not be Mrs. de Pourceaugnac.
Pourceaugnac! Was ever such a name heard of!<a href="#fmdp1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp1r" id="fmdp1r"></a> No, I could never put
up with Pourceaugnac; and we will abuse the man to such an extent, and
play him so many tricks, that he will have to return to Limoges, Mr.
de Pourceaugnac.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Here is our cunning Neapolitan, who will give us news.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.&mdash;&mdash;JULIA, &Eacute;RASTE, SBRIGANI, N&Eacute;RINE.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Our man has just come, Sir. I saw him at a place three leagues
away from here, where the coach stops; and I studied him for more than
half an hour in the kitchen, where he went down to breakfast, and I
know him now perfectly. As to his appearance, I will say nothing about
it; you will see for yourselves what nature has done for him, and if
his dress is not the very thing to set that off. But as for his
understanding, I can tell you beforehand that it is among the dullest
I have met with for a long time. We shall find in him a fit subject to
work upon as we like. He is just the man to fall into all the traps
laid for him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Is all that possible?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Perfectly true, and I am skilled in the knowledge of men.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>. (<i>pointing to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>). This is a famous man, Madam; and your
affair could not be trusted to better hands. He is the hero of the
age, for the wonders he has performed. A man who, twenty times in his
life, has generously braved the galleys to serve his friends; who, at
the peril of his arms and shoulders,<a href="#fmdp2"><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp2r" id="fmdp2r"></a> knows how to bring to a
successful issue the most difficult enterprises; and who is, in short,
banished from his country for I don't know how many honourable actions
he has generously engaged in.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I am ashamed to hear the praises with which you honour me, and I
could most justly extol the marvellous things you did in your life; I
could particularly speak of the glory you acquired when you cheated at
play that young nobleman we brought to your house, and won twelve
thousand crowns from him; when you handsomely made that false contract
which ruined a whole family; when with such greatness of soul you
denied all knowledge of the deposit which had been entrusted to you,
and so generously gave evidence which hung two innocent people.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
These are trifles not worth mentioning, and your praises make me
blush.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Then I will spare your modesty. Let us leave that aside, and
speak of our business. To begin with, I will quickly rejoin our
countryman, while you, on your side, will see that all the other
actors in the comedy are kept in readiness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
And you, Madam, pray remember your part, that in order to conceal
our aim the better, you are to affect to be quite perfectly delighted
with your father's resolutions.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
If it only depends on that, things will be sure to succeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
But, dear Julia, if everything were to fail?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I will declare my real inclinations to my father.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
And if he persists in his designs in spite of your inclinations?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I will threaten to shut myself up in a convent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
But if, notwithstanding all that, he wished to force you to this
marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Why, what would you have me say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
What do I want you to say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
What is said when one loves truly?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
But what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
That nothing shall force you; that in spite of all your father
can do, you promise to be mine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Ah me! &Eacute;raste, be satisfied with what I do now, and leave the
future alone. Do not perplex me in my duty, by speaking of sad
expedients to which we may not be obliged to have recourse. Allow me
to be led by the course of events.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Will &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Sir, here is our man. Be careful.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ner</span>.
Ah! what a guy!<a href="#fmdp3"><small><sup>3</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp3r" id="fmdp3r"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE V.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>turning to the side he came from, and speaking to the
people who are following him</i>). Well, what is it? What is the matter?
What do you want? Deuce take this stupid town, and the people who live
in it! Nobody can walk a step without meeting a lot of asses staring
and laughing like fools at one. You boobies, mind your business; and
let folk pass without grinning in their faces. Deuce take me if I
don't knock down the first man I see laughing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>speaking to the same people</i>). What are you about? What is the
meaning of such conduct? What is it you want? Is it right to make fun
like that of strangers who come here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Here is a man of sense at last.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
What manners! And what is there to laugh at?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Is there anything ridiculous in this gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I ask you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Is he not like other people?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Am I crooked or hunchbacked?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Learn to distinguish people.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Well said.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
This gentleman's qualities call for your respect.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Perfectly true.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
He is a person of quality.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes, a gentleman from Limoges.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
A man of intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Who has studied the law.<a href="#fmdp4"><small><sup>4</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp4r" id="fmdp4r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
He does you too much honour in coming to this town.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ay, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
This gentleman has nothing in him that can make you laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And the first who laughs at him, I will call to account.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>).
Sir, I am extremely, obliged to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I am sorry, Sir, to see a person like you received after such a
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Your servant, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I saw you breakfasting this morning, Sir, with the other
passengers; and the grace with which you ate created in me at once a
great friendship for you; and as I know that you have never been here
before, and that you are a perfect stranger, I am glad I met you, to
offer you my services at your arrival, and to assist you among these
people, who do not always behave to strangers of quality as they
should.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You are really very kind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I have told you already; the moment I saw you, I felt an
inclination for you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am greatly obliged to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Your countenance pleased me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You do me much honour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I read honesty in it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am your servant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Something amiable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Graceful.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Majestic.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And cordial.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Believe that I am entirely yours.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am greatly obliged to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I speak from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
If I had the honour of being known to you, you would find that I
am altogether sincere.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I do not doubt it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
An enemy to deceit.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I feel sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And that I am incapable of disguising my thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It is exactly what I think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You look at my dress, which is not like that of other people;
but I came originally from Naples, at your service; and I always like
to keep up the way of dressing as well as the sincerity of my
country.<a href="#fmdp5"><small><sup>5</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp5r" id="fmdp5r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You are quite right. For my part, I was desirous of
appearing in the court dress for the country.<a href="#fmdp6"><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp6r" id="fmdp6r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Truly, it becomes you better than it does all our courtiers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Exactly what my tailor told me. The coat is suitable and
rich; it will tell here among these people.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You will go to the Louvre, no doubt?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; I must go and pay my court.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
The king will be charmed to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Have you fixed upon rooms?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
No; I was going to look for some.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I shall be very glad to go with you; I know all this city well.</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.&mdash;&mdash;&Eacute;RASTE, MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Ah, who is this? What do I see? What a happy meeting! Mr. de
Pourceaugnac! How delighted I am to see you! What! anyone would think
that you find it difficult to remember me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Sir, I am your servant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Is it possible that five or six years can have made you forget
me? Do you not remember the best friend of the de Pourceaugnacs?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes, yes. (<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>)
Deuce take me if I know who
he is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
There is not one of the de Pourceaugnacs of Limoges that I do
not know, from the greatest to the smallest; I visited only them
during my stay there, and I had the honour of seeing you every day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
The honour was mine, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
You do not remember my face?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Yes, yes.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>) I don't know him a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
You do not remember that I had the pleasure of drinking with you
I don't know how many times?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Excuse me.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>)
I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
What is the name of that pastrycook who cooks such capital
dinners?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Petit-Jean.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Just so. We used often to go there together to enjoy ourselves.
How do you call that place where people go for a walk?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
The cemetery of the Ar&egrave;nes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Exactly. It is there I enjoyed so many happy hours of your
pleasant talk. Don't you remember it all now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Pardon me; yes, I remember.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>) Deuce take
me if I do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>aside to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>).
There are a hundred
things like that which one is apt to forget altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Let us embrace, I pray, and renew our former friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>).
This man seems to have a great
affection for you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Tell me some news of all the family. How is that gentleman
your &#8230; he who is such an honest man?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
My brother the sheriff?
<a href="#fmdp7"><small><sup>7</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp7r" id="fmdp7r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
He is as well as can be.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
I am delighted to hear it. And that good tempered man? You know,
your &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
My cousin, the assessor?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Always gay and hearty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
It gives me much pleasure to hear it. And your uncle, the &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I have no uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
But you had one in those days?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
No; only an aunt&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Ah! it's what I meant; your aunt; Mrs&#8230;. How is she?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
She died six months ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Alas! poor woman. She was so good, too!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
We have also my nephew, the canon, who almost died of the
smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
What a pity if it had happened!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Do you know him also?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Indeed I do; a tall handsome fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Not so very tall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
No; but well-shaped.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
He's your nephew, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Son of your brother or your sister?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. True.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
A canon of the church of&#8230;. How do you call it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Saint Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Just so; I don't know any other.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>).
He knows all my relations.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
He knows you better than you think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You must have lived a long time in our town, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Two whole years.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You were there, then, when our governor was godfather to my
cousin the assessor's child?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
To be sure; I was one of the first invited.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
The thing was well done.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Very.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
The dinner was well got up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Then you must remember the quarrel I had with that gentleman
from P&eacute;rigord.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
He met with his match, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
He slapped my face; but I paid him back handsomely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Very handsomely. By the bye, I shall not allow you to go to any
other house but mine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I would not&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Nonsense! I will not allow one of my best friends to go anywhere
but to my house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It would be disturb&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
No; deuce take it all. You shall stay with me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>. (<i>to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>).
Since he will have it so, I advise
you to accept.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Where is your luggage?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
With my servant, where we stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Send somebody to fetch it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
No. I forbade him to let it go out of his sight, for fear
of swindlers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You did quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It is good to be cautious in this place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
We always know a man of sense.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I will accompany this gentleman, and bring him back where you
wish.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Do so. I have a few orders to give; but you only need come to
that house yonder.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
We will come back presently.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>).
I shall expect you with great
impatience.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>).
I find an acquaintance when I little
expected to meet with one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
He looks like an honest man. (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. (<i>alone</i>).
Ah! ah! Mr. de Pourceaugnac, you will get it hot!
Everything is ready, and I have only to give the word. Soho! there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.&mdash;&mdash;&Eacute;RASTE, AN APOTHECARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
I think, Sir, that you are the doctor to whom somebody went to
speak in my name.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
No, Sir. I am not the doctor; such an honour does not belong to
me. I am only an unworthy apothecary; at your service.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Is the doctor at home, then.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Yes; he is in there, trying to get rid quickly of some patients.
I will tell him that you are here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
No; you need not disturb him; I will wait till he has done. I
have to entrust to his care a certain relation of mine he was told
about today. He is attacked with a sort of madness that we should
like to see cured before we marry him to anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
I know; I know all about it. I was there when he was told of this
affair. Upon my word, Sir; upon my word, you could not apply to a more
skilful doctor. He is a man who understands medicine thoroughly, as
well as I do my A B C;<a href="#fmdp8"><small><sup>8</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp8r" id="fmdp8r"></a> and who, were you to die for it, would not
abate one iota of the rules of the ancients. Yes, he always follows
the high-road&mdash;the high-road, Sir, and doesn't spend his time finding
out mares' nests. For all the gold in the world he would not cure
anybody with other medicines than those prescribed by the faculty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
He is quite right. A patient should not wish to be cured unless
the faculty consents to it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
It is not because we are great friends that I speak so of him;
but it is a pleasure to be his patient, and I had rather die by his
medicines than be cured with those of another. For, whatever may
happen, we know for certain that things are always in due order; and
should we die under his care, our heirs have nothing to reproach us
with.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
A great comfort to a dead man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Certainly; it is pleasant to have died according to rules.
Moreover, he is not one of those doctors who let a disease off. He is
an expeditious man&mdash;expeditious, Sir, who likes to clear off his
patients; and when they are to die, the thing is done in no time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
There is, to be sure, nothing like going through the business
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Indeed, what is the use of haggling over the matter, and beating
so long about the bush? One should know offhand the long and short of
an illness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
You are quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Why, he did me the honour of taking care of three of my children;
they died in less than four days, whereas with another they would have
lingered for more than three months.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
It is a blessing to have friends like these.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Decidedly. I have still two children left, of whom he takes care
as if they were his own; he attends them, and physics them as he
pleases, without my interfering in the least; and very frequently on
my return from the city, I am quite surprised to find that they have
been bled or purged by his direction.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
This is kind care indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
Here he is, here he is; here he is coming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.&mdash;&mdash;&Eacute;RASTE, 1ST PHYSICIAN, APOTHECARY, COUNTRYMAN,
COUNTRYWOMAN.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Man</span>.
Sir, he can hold out no longer; he says he feels the greatest
pains imaginable in his head.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
The patient is a fool; for in the disease by which he is
attacked it is not his head, according to Galen, but the spleen,
which must give pain.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Man</span>.
However this may be, Sir, he has had for the last six months
a laxity with it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
That's right. It is a sign that his body is clearing. I will
go and see him in two or three days; but if he dies before, mind you
do not forget to give me notice, for it is not proper that a doctor
should go to visit a dead man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Wom</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Physician</span>).
My father, Sir, is getting worse and worse.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is no fault of mine; I send him remedies; why does he not
get better? How many times has he been bled?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Wom</span>.
Fifteen times, Sir, in twenty days.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Fifteen times?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Wom</span>.
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
And he does not get better?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">C. Wom</span>.
No, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is a sign that the seat of the malady is not in the blood. He
must be purged as many times, to see if it is in the humours; and if
this does not succeed, we will send him to the bath.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Apo</span>.
This is the <i>beau-id&eacute;al</i> of physic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IX.&mdash;&mdash;&Eacute;RASTE, 1ST PHYSICIAN, APOTHECARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to the</i> <span class="smallcaps">Physician</span>).
It was I, Sir, who sent to you few days ago
about a relation of mine who is not quite right in his mind; and I
want him to live in your house, as it would be more convenient for you
to attend to him, and to prevent him from being seen by too many
people.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Yes, Sir, I have got everything ready; and I will take the
utmost care of him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Here he is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
That is most fortunate; for I have with me just now an old
physician, a friend of mine, with whom I should be glad to consult
concerning this disorder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE X.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, &Eacute;RASTE, 1ST PHYSICIAN, APOTHECARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. De Pourceaugnac</span>).
I am obliged to leave you a moment
for a little affair which requires my presence; (<i>showing the</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Physician</span>)
but this person, in whose hands I leave you, will do for
you all he possibly can.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
I am bound by my profession to do so; and it is enough that
you should lay this duty upon me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>aside</i>).
It is his steward, no doubt; he must be a man of
quality.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">&Eacute;raste</span>).
Yes, Sir; I assure you that I shall treat this
gentleman methodically, and in strict accordance with the rules of our
art.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Indeed, I do not ask for so much ceremony; and I have not
come here to trouble you so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Such a duty is a pleasure to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">1st Physician</span>).
Nevertheless, here are ten pistoles
beforehand, as an earnest of what I have promised you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
No, if you please; I won't hear of your spending anything
on my account, nor do I wish you to send for anything particular for
me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Ah, pray, do not trouble yourself; it is not for that you
imagine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I beg of you to treat me only as a friend.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. It is exactly what I mean to do.
(<i>Aside to the</i> <span class="smallcaps">Physician</span>.) I
particularly recommend you not to let him slip out of your hands, for
at times he tries to escape.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
You need not fear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. De Pourceaugnac</span>).
Pray excuse the incivility I
commit.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Don't mention it. You are really too kind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XI.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, 1ST PHYSICIAN, 2ND PHYSICIAN,
APOTHECARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is a great honour to me to be chosen to do you a service.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am your servant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Here is a clever man, one of my brethren, with whom I will
consult concerning the manner of our treating you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
There is no need of so much ceremony, I tell you; I am
easily satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Bring some seats. (<i>Servants come in and place chairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>aside</i>).
These servants are rather dismal for a young man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Now, Sir; take a seat, Sir. (<i>The two</i> <span class="smallcaps">Physicians</span>
<i>make</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. De Pourceaugnac</span> <i>sit between them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>seated</i>). Your very humble servant.
(<i>Each</i> <span class="smallcaps">Physician</span>
<i>takes one of his hands, and feels his pulse.</i>) What are you about?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Do you eat well, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; and drink still better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
So much the worse! That great craving for cold and wet is a
sign of the heat and aridity that is within. Do you sleep well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; when I have made a hearty supper.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Do you dream much?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Now and then.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Of what nature are your dreams?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Of the nature of dreams. What the deuce is the meaning of
this conversation?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Have a little patience. We will reason upon your affair in
your presence; and we will do it in the vulgar tongue, so that you may
understand better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What great reasoning is there wanted to eat a mouthful?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Since it is a fact that we cannot cure any disease without
first knowing it perfectly, and that we cannot know it perfectly
without first establishing its exact nature and its true species by
its diagnosis and prognosis, you will give me leave, you, my senior,
to enter upon the consideration of the disease that is in question,
before we think of the therapeutics and the remedies that we must
decide upon in order to effect a perfect cure. I say then, Sir, if you
will allow me, that our patient here present is unhappily attacked,
affected, possessed, and disordered by that kind of madness which we
properly name hypochondriac melancholy; a very trying kind of madness,
and which requires no less than an &AElig;sculapius deeply versed in our
art like you; you, I say, who have become grey in harness, as the
saying hath it; and through whose hands so much business of all sorts
has passed. I call it hypochondriac melancholy, to distinguish it from
the other two; for the celebrated Galen establishes and decides in a
most learned manner, as is usual with him, that there are three
species of the disease which we call melancholy, so called, not only
by the Latins, but also by the Greeks; which in this case is worthy of
remark: the first, which arises from a direct disease of the brain;
the second, which proceeds from the whole of the blood, made and
rendered atrabilious; and the third, termed hypochondriac, which is
our case here, and which proceeds from some lower part of the abdomen;
and from the inferior regions, but particularly the spleen; the heat
and inflammation whereof sends up to the brain of our patient
abundance of thick and foul fuliginosities; of which the black and
gross vapours cause deterioration to the functions of the principal
faculty, and cause the disease by which he is manifestly accused and
convicted. In proof of what I say, and as an incontestable diagnostic
of it, you need only consider that great seriousness, that sadness,
accompanied by signs of fearfulness and suspicion&mdash;pathognomonic and
particular symptoms of this disease, so well defined by the divine
ancient Hippocrates; that countenance, those red and staring eyes,
that long beard, that habit of body, thin, emaciated, black, and
hairy&mdash;signs denoting him greatly affected by the disease proceeding
from a defect in the hypochondria; which disease, by lapse of time,
being naturalised, chronic, habitual, ingrained, and established
within him, might well degenerate either into monomania, or into
phthisis, or into apoplexy, or even into downright frenzy and raving.
All this being taken for granted, since a disease well-known is a
disease half cured, for <i>ignoti nulla est curatio morbis</i>, it will not
be difficult for you to conclude what are the remedies needed by our
patient. First of all, to remedy this obdurate plethora, and this
luxuriant cacochymy throughout the body, I opine that he should be
freely phlebotomised; by which I mean that there should be frequent
and abundant bleedings, first in the basilic vein, then in the
cephalic vein; and if the disease be obstinate, that even the vein of
the forehead should be opened, and that the orifice be large, so that
the thick blood may issue out; and, at the same time, that he should
be purged, deobstructed, and evacuated by fit and suitable purgatives,
i.e. by chologues and melanogogues. And as the real source of all this
mischief is either a foul and feculent humour or a black and gross
vapour, which obscures, empoisons, and contaminates the animal
spirits, it is proper afterwards that he should have a bath of pure
and clean water, with abundance of whey; to purify, by the water, the
feculency of the foul humour, and by the whey to clarify the blackness
of the vapour. But, before all things, I think it desirable to enliven
him by pleasant conversations, by vocal and instrumental music, to
which it will not be amiss to add dancers, that their movements,
figures, and agility may stir up and awaken the sluggishness of his
spirits, which occasions the thickness of his blood from whence the
disease proceeds. These are the remedies I propose, to which may be
added many better ones by you, Sir, my master and senior, according to
the experience, judgment, knowledge and sufficiency that you have
acquired in our art. <i>Dixi.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">2nd Phy</span>.
Heaven forbid, Sir, that it should enter my thoughts to add
anything to what you have just been saying! You have discoursed too
well on all the signs, symptoms, and causes of this gentleman's
disease. The arguments you have used are so learned and so delicate
that it is impossible for him not to be mad and hypochondriacally
melancholic; or, were he not, that he ought to become so, because of
the beauty of the things you have spoken, and of the justness of your
reasoning. Yes, Sir, you have graphically depicted, <i>graphice
depinxisti</i>, everything that appertains to this disease. Nothing can
be more learnedly, judiciously, and ingeniously conceived, thought,
imagined, than what you have delivered on the subject of this disease,
either as regards the diagnostic, the prognostic, or the therapeutic;
and nothing remains for me to do but to congratulate this gentleman
upon falling into your hands, and to tell him that he is but too
fortunate to be mad, in order to experience the gentle efficacy of the
remedies you have so judiciously proposed. I approve them in toto,
<i>manibus et pedibus descendo in tuam sententiam</i>. All I should like to
add is to let all his bleedings and purgings be of an odd number,
<i>numero deus impare gaudet</i>, to take the whey before the bath, and to
make him a forehead plaster, in the composition of which there should
be salt&mdash;salt is a symbol of wisdom; to whitewash the walls of his
room, to dissipate the gloominess of his mind; <i>album est
disgregativum visas</i>; and to give him a little injection immediately,
to serve as a prelude and introduction to those judicious remedies,
from which, if he is curable, he must receive relief. Heaven grant
that these remedies, which are yours, Sir, may succeed with the
patient according to our wish!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Gentlemen, I have been listening to you for the last hour.
Are we acting a comedy here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
No, Sir; we are not acting a comedy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What does it all mean? What are you about with this
gibberish and nonsense of yours?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Ah! Insulting language! A diagnostic which was wanting for
the confirmation of his disease. This may turn to mania.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>aside</i>). With what kind of people have they left me here.
(<i>He spits two or three times.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Another diagnostic: frequent expectoration.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Let us cease all this, and go away.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Another: anxiety to move about.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What is the meaning of all this business? What do you want
with me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
To cure you, according to the order we have received.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Cure me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
S'death! I am not ill.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is a bad sign when a patient does not feel his illness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I tell you that I am quite well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
We know better than you how you are; we are physicians who
see plainly into your constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
If you are physicians, I have nothing to do with you; and I
snap my fingers at all your physic.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
H'm! h'm! This man is madder than we thought.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
My father and mother would never have anything to do with
remedies; and they both died without the help of doctors.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
I do not wonder if they have begotten a son who is mad. (<i>To
the</i> <span class="smallcaps">2nd Physician</span>.)
Come, let us begin the cure; and, through the
exhilarating sweetness of harmony, let us dulcify, lenify, and pacify
the acrimony of his spirits, which, I see, are ready to be inflamed.

<h2>ACT II.</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.&mdash;&mdash;1ST PHYSICIAN, SBRIGANI.</h3>


<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
He has forced through every obstacle I had placed to hinder
him, and has fled from the remedies I was beginning to prepare for
him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
To avoid remedies so salutary as yours is to be a great enemy to
oneself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is the mark of a disturbed brain and of a depraved reason
to be unwilling to be cured.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You would have cured him, for certain, in no time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Certainly; though there had been the complication of a dozen
diseases.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
With all that he makes you lose those fifty well-earned
pistoles.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
I have no intention of losing them; and I am determined to
cure him in spite of himself. He is bound and engaged to take my
remedies; and I will have him seized, wherever I can find him, as a
deserter from physic and an infringer of my prescriptions.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You are right. Your medicines were sure of their effect; and it
is so much money he takes from you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Where could I find him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
No doubt, at the house of that goodman Oronte, whose daughter he
comes to marry; and who, knowing nothing of the infirmity of his
future son-in-law, will perhaps be in a hurry to conclude the
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
I will go and speak to him at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You should, in justice to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
He is in need of my consultations; and a patient must not
make a fool of his doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
That is well said; and, if I were you, I would not suffer him to
marry till you have physicked him to your heart's content.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Leave that to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>. (<i>aside, and going</i>).
For my part, I will bring another battery
into play; for the father-in-law is as much of a dupe as the
son-in-law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, 1ST PHYSICIAN.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
A certain gentleman, Sir, a Mr. de Pourceaugnac, is to marry
your daughter; is he not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Yes; I expect him from Limoges, and he ought to have been here
before now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
And he has come; he has run away from my house, after having
been placed under my care; but I forbid you, in the name of the
faculty, to proceed with the marriage you have decided upon, before I
have duly prepared him for it, and put him in a state to have children
well-conditioned both in mind and body.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
What is it you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Your intended son-in-law was entered as my patient. His
disease which was given me to cure is a chattel which belongs to me,
and which I reckon among my possessions. I therefore declare to you
that I will not allow him to marry before he has rendered due
satisfaction to the faculty, and submitted to the remedies which I
have ordered for him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
He is suffering from some disease?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
And from what disease, if you please?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Don't trouble yourself about that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Is it some disease&#8230;.?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Doctors are bound to keep things secret. Let it suffice you
that I enjoin both you and your daughter not to celebrate the wedding
without my consent, upon pain of incurring the displeasure of the
faculty, and of undergoing all the diseases which we choose to lay
upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
If that is the case, I shall take good care to put a stop to the
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
He was entrusted to me, and he is bound to be my patient.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
It is in vain for him to run away; I will have him sentenced
to be cured by me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I am very willing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
Yes; he must either die or be cured by me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I consent to it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
And if I cannot find him, I will make you answerable, and
cure you instead of him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I am in very good health.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">1st Phy</span>.
No matter. I must have a patient, and I will take anyone I
can.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Take whom you will, but it shall not be me. (<i>Alone</i>) Did you
ever hear of such a thing!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, SBRIGANI <i>as a Flemish merchant</i>.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Sir, py your leafe, I pe one voreign marchant, and vould like
ask you one littel news.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
What, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Put you de hat on de head, Sir, if you pleace.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Tell me. Sir, what you want.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I tell nozink, Sir, if you not put de hat on de head.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Very well, then, what is it, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You not know in dis town one Mister Oronte?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Yes, I know him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And vat for one man is he, Sir, if you pleace?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
He is like any other man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I ask you, Sir, if he one man of money is?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
But very mooch rich, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It does me mooch pleasure, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
But why should it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It is, Sir, for one littel great reason for us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
But why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It is, Sir, dat dis Mr. Oronte his tauchter in marriage to a
certain Mr. Pourgnac gifes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>. Well!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And dis Mr. Pourgnac, Sir, is one man vat owes mooch golt to ten
or twelf Flemish marchants vat come here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>. T
his Mr. de Pourceaugnac owes a great deal to ten or twelve
merchants?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes, Sir; and for de last eight months ve hafe obtain one littel
judgment against him, and he put off all de credeetors till dis
marriage vat Mr. Oronte gifes to his tauchter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Ho! ho! So he puts off paying his creditors till then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes, Sir; and vid great defotion ve all wait for dis marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
The idea is not bad. (<i>Aloud</i>) I wish you good day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I tank de gentleman for de favour great.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Your very humble servant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I pe, Sir, more great obliged don all py de goot news vat the
Mister gife me. (<i>Alone, after having taken off his beard, and taken
off the Flemish dress which he has put over his</i>) Things don't go
badly. All is going on swimmingly. I must throw off this disguise and
think of something else. We will put so much suspicion between the
father-in-law and his son-in-law that the intended marriage must come
to nothing. They are both equally fit to swallow the baits that are
laid for them, and it is mere child's play for us great sharpers when
we find such easy gulls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>thinking himself alone</i>).
<i>Piglialo s&ugrave;, piglialo s&ugrave;,
Signor Monsu</i>. What the deuce does it all mean?
(<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>)
Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
What is the matter, Sir? what ails you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Everything I see seems injection.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
How is that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You can't think what has happened to me in that house where
you took me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
No! What has happened?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I thought I should be well feasted there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I leave you in this gentleman's hands. Doctors dressed in
black. In a chair. Feel the pulse. In proof of what I say. He is mad.
Two big, fat-faced fellows, with large-brimmed hats. <i>Buon d&igrave;, buon
d&igrave;.</i> Six pantaloons. Ta, ra, ta, toi, ta, ra, ta, ta, toi.
<i>Allegramente, Monsu Pourceaugnac</i>. Take, Sir; take, take. It is
gentle, gentle, gentle. <i>Piglialo s&ugrave;, Signor Monsu; piglialo, piglialo
s&ugrave;.</i> I never was so surfeited with absurdities in all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
What does it all mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It means, Sir, that this gentleman, with all his kissing and
hugging, is a deceitful rascal, who has sent me to that house to play
me some trick.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Is it possible?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It is, indeed. They were a dozen devils at my heels, and I
had all the difficulty in the world to escape out of their clutches.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Just fancy how deceitful people's looks are; I should have taken
him for the most affectionate friend you have. It is a wonder to me
how there can exist such rascals in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
My imagination is full of it all; and it seems to me that I
see everywhere a dozen injections threatening me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
This is really too bad! how treacherous and wicked people are!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Pray, tell me where Mr. Oronte lives. I should be glad to go
there at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Ah! ah! you are of a loving disposition, I see; and you have
heard that Mr. Oronte has a daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; I am come to marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
To ma &#8230; to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
In wedlock?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
How could it be otherwise?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Oh! it is another thing, and I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What is it you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
But, pray!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Nothing, I tell you. I spoke rather hastily.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I beg of you to tell me what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
No; it is not necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Pray do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
No; I beg you to excuse me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What! are you not one of my friends?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes, certainly; nobody more so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Then you ought not to hide anything from me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It is a thing in which a neighbour's honour is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
That I may oblige you to treat me like a friend, here is a
small ring I beg of you to keep for my sake.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Let me consider a little if I can in conscience do it. (<i>Goes
away a small distance from</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>.) He is a man who
looks after his own interests, who tries to provide for his daughter
as advantageously as possible; and one should injure nobody. It is
true that these things are no secret; but I shall be telling them to a
man who knows nothing about it, and it is forbidden to talk scandal of
one's neighbour. All this is true. On the other hand, however, here is
a stranger they want to impose upon, who comes in all good faith to
marry a girl he knows nothing about, and whom he has never seen. A
gentleman all openheartedness, for whom I feel some inclination, who
does me the honour of reckoning me his friend, puts his confidence in
me, and gives me a ring to keep for his sake.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>)
Yes, I think that I can tell you how things are without
wounding my conscience. But I must try to tell it all to you in the
mildest way possible, and to spare people as much as I can. If I were
to tell you that this girl leads a bad life, it would be going too
far. I must find some milder term to explain myself. The word coquette
does not come up to the mark; that of downright flirt seems to me to
answer the purpose pretty well, and I can make use of it to tell you
honestly what she is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
They want to make a fool of me then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
But it may not be so bad as people think; and after all, there
are men who set themselves above such things, and who do not think
that their honour depends upon&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am your servant; I have no wish to adorn my person with
such a head-dress, and the Pourceaugnacs are accustomed to walk with
their heads free.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Here is the father.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Who? this old man?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes. Allow me to withdraw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SCENE V.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Good morning, Sir; good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Your servant, Sir; your servant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
You are Mr. Oronte; are you not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
And I, Mr. de Pourceaugnac.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Ah, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Do you think, Mr. Oronte, that the people of Limoges are
fools?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Do you think, Mr. de Pourceaugnac, that the people of Paris are
asses?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Do you imagine, Mr. Oronte, that a man like me can be dying
for a wife?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Do you imagine, Mr. de Pourceaugnac, that a daughter like mine
can be dying for a husband?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, JULIA, ORONTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I have just been told, father, that Mr. de Pourceaugnac has come.
Ah, there he is, no doubt; my heart tells me so. How handsome he is!
How splendidly he holds himself. How pleased I am to have such a
husband!<a href="#fmdp11"><small><sup>11</sup></small></a><a name="fmdp11r" id="fmdp11r"></a>
Give me leave to kiss him and to show him&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>. Softly, daughter, softly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>aside</i>).
Heyday! At what a pace she goes, and how she
takes fire!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I should very much like to know, Mr. de Pourceaugnac, for what
reason you &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>. (<i>approaches</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span>, <i>looks at him with a
languishing look, and tries to take his hand</i>). How pleased I am to
see you! And how impatient I am to &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Hey! daughter, go away; will you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>aside</i>).
What a free and easy young damsel!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I should like to know what made you have the boldness to&#8230;.
(<span class="smallcaps">Julia</span> <i>continues as above</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. (<i>aside</i>). By Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julia</span>).
Again! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
May I not kiss the husband you have chosen for me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
No; go in.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Allow me to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Go in, I tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I should like to stop here, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I will not suffer it. If you do not go in immediately, I &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Very well then, I will go in.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
My daughter is a foolish girl who does not understand things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>aside</i>). How taken she is with me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>. (
<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julia</span>, <i>who has stopped</i>).
You won't go.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
When will yon marry me to this gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Never. You are not intended for him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I will have him, I will have him; you promised him to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
If I promised him to you, I take my promise back again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
(<i>aside</i>). She would fain eat me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Do what you will, we will be married in spite of everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I shall know how to prevent it, I forewarn you. What madness has
taken hold of her?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I say, our intended father-in-law, don't give yourself so
much trouble; I have no intention of running away with your daughter;
and your pretence won't take at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
And yours will in no way succeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Did you think that Leonardo de Pourceaugnac is a man to buy
a pig in a poke, and that he has not the sense to find out what goes
on in the world, and to see if, in marrying, his honour is safe?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I do not know what you mean; but did you take into your head
that a man of sixty-three years old has so little common sense, and
so little consideration for his daughter, as to marry her to a man
who has you know what, and who was put with a doctor to be cured?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
This is a trick that was practised upon me, and there is
nothing the matter with me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
The doctor told us so himself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
The doctor told a lie. I am a gentleman, and I will meet
him sword in hand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I know what I ought to believe, and you can no more impose upon
me in this matter than about the debts you are bound to pay on your
marriage day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What debts?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
It is of no use to affect ignorance. I have seen the Flemish
merchant who with other creditors obtained a decision against you
eight months ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What Flemish merchant? What creditors? What decision
obtained against me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
You know perfectly well what I mean.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XI.&mdash;&mdash;SBRIGANI (<i>alone</i>).</h3>

<p>Everything has been done according to my wish, and is succeeding
admirably. We will so weary out our provincial that he will only be
too thankful to leave the place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XII.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! I am murdered! What vexation! What a cursed town!
Assassinated everywhere!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
What is it, Sir? Has anything new happened?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; it rains doctors and women in this country.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
How is that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Two jabbering jades have just been accusing me of being
married to both of them, and have threatened me with justice.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
This is a bad business, for in this country justice is terribly
rigorous against that sort of crime.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Yes; but even if there should be information, citation,
decree, and verdict obtained by surprise, default, and contumacy, I
have still the alternative of a conflict of jurisdiction to gain time,
and a resort to the means of nullity that will be found in the court
case.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
The very terms, and it is easy to see that you are in the
profession, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I? Certainly not; I am a gentleman.<a href="#fmdp14"><small><sup>14</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp14r" id="fmdp14r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
But to speak as you do, you must have studied the law.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Not at all. It is only common sense which tells me that I
shall always be admitted to be justified by facts, and that I could
not be condemned upon a simple accusation, without witnesses,
evidence, and confrontation with my adverse party.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
This is more clever still.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
These words come into my head without my knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It seems to me that the common sense of a gentleman may go so
far as to understand what belongs to right and the order of justice,
but not to know the very terms of chicane.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
They are a few words I remember from reading novels.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>. Ah! I see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
To show you that I understand nothing of chicane, I beg of
you to take me to a lawyer to have advice upon this affair.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Willingly. I will take you to two very clever men; but, first, I
must tell you not to be surprised at their manner of speaking. They
have contracted at the bar a certain habit of declaiming which looks
like singing, and you would think all they tell you is nothing but
music.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It does not matter how they speak, as long as they tell me
what I wish to know!</p>

<h2>ACT III.</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.&mdash;&mdash;&Eacute;RASTE, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes; everything is succeeding splendidly; and as his knowledge
of things is very shallow, and his understanding of the poorest, I put
him in such a terrible fright at the severity of the law in this
country, and at the preparations which were already set on foot to put
him to death,<a href="#fmdp16"><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp16r" id="fmdp16r"></a> that he is determined to run away, and in order the
better to escape from the people who, I have told him, are placed at
the city gates to stop him, he has decided upon disguising himself as
a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
How I should like to see him dressed up in that way!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Take care you carry out the farce properly; and whilst I go
through my parts with him, you go and &#8230; (<i>Whispers to him.</i>) You
understand, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And when I have taken him where I mean&#8230;. (<i>Whispers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
All right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
And when the father has been forewarned by me&#8230;.
(<i>Whispers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>. Nothing could be better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Here is our young lady. Go quickly; she must not see us
together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC (<i>as a lady</i>), SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
For my part, I don't think any one can know you, and you look
exactly like a lady of birth.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am so astonished that in this province the forms of
justice should not be observed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes; as I have already told you, they begin by hanging a man,
and try him afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What unjust justice!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
It is devilishly severe, particularly on this kind of crime.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Still, when one is innocent?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Ah me! They care little for that, and, besides, they have here a
most intolerable hatred for the people of your province; and nothing
gives them more pleasure than to hang a man from Limoges.
<a href="#fmdp17"><small><sup>17</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp17r" id="fmdp17r"></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What have the people from Limoges done to them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
How do I know? They are downright brutes, enemies to all the
gentility and merit of other cities. For my part, I am in the greatest
fear on your account, and I should never comfort myself if you were
hanged.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It is not so much the fear of death that urges me to fly as
the fact of being hanged, for it is a most degrading thing for a
gentleman, and would ruin one's title of nobility.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You are right; after such a thing they would contest your right
of bearing a title of nobility.<a href="#fmdp18"><small><sup>18</sup></small></a>
<a name="fmdp18r" id="fmdp18r"></a> But, be careful, when I lead you
by the hand, to walk like a woman, and to assume the manners and the
language of a lady of quality.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Leave that to me; I have seen people of high standing in the
world. The only thing that troubles me is that I have somewhat of a
beard.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Oh! it's not worth mentioning. There are many women who have as
much. Now, let us just see how you will behave yourself.
(<span class="smallcaps">Mr. de
Pourceaugnac</span> <i>mimics a lady of rank.</i>) Good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Why, my carriage is not here! Where is my carriage? Gracious
me! how wretched to have such attendants! Shall I have to wait all day
in the street? Will not some one call my carriage for me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Very good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Soho! there, coachman. Little page! Ah! little rogue, what a
whipping you will get by and by! Little page-boy! little page-boy!
Where in the world is that page-boy? Will that little page never be
found? Will nobody call that little page for me? Is my little page
nowhere to be found?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Marvellous! But there is one thing that I see does not do. This
hood is a little too thin; I must go and fetch you a thicker one, to
hide your face better in case of any accident.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
What shall I do in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Wait for me here. I will be back in a moment; you have only to
walk about.</p>

<h3>SCENE V.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, THREE POLICE OFFICERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I am much obliged to you, Sir, for saving me from those
insolent fellows.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
Oh! oh! This is a face which is deucedly like that which was
described to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
It is not I, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
Oh! oh! what does this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
What is it, then, that makes you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
This manner of speaking is somewhat ambiguous, and you are my
prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
O, Sir, I pray!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
No, no; to judge by your appearance and your manner of speaking,
you must be that Mr. de Pourceaugnac we are looking for, although you
are disguised in this manner, and you must come to prison at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Alas!</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.&mdash;&mdash;MR. DE POURCEAUGNAC, SBRIGANI, THREE POLICE OFFICERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. de Pourceaugnac</span> ).
Heavens! what does this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
They have discovered who I am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
Yes, yes; I am delighted about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>to the</i> <span class="smallcaps">Officer</span>).
Ah, Sir! for my sake! do not take him to
prison; you know that we have been friends a long while.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
I cannot help it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
You are a man to hear reason. Is there no way of adjusting this
matter with the help of a few pistoles?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.

You must give him some money for him
to let you go. Be quick.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.

Be quick, I tell you; don't waste time; you would be happy,
would you not, if you were hanged?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pour</span>.
Ah! (<i>Gives more money to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>to the</i> <span class="smallcaps">Officer</span>). Here, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sbrigani</span>).
I must go off with him, for I should not be in
safety here after this. Leave him to me, and don't stir from this
place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
I beg of you to take the utmost care of him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Off</span>.
I promise you not to leave him one moment till I see him safe.</p>

Farewell! This is the first honest man I
have found in this town.</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
(<i>affecting not to see</i> <span class="smallcaps">Oronte</span>).
Ah! What a strange adventure!
What terrible news for a father! Poor Oronte, how much I pity you!
What will you say? How will you ever be able to bear with such a
misfortune?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
What is it? Of what misfortune do you speak?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Ah, Sir! This wretch of a Limousin has run away with your
daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Run away with my daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Sbri</span>.
Yes; she became so infatuated with him that she has left you to
follow him. It is said that he has a charm to make all women fall in
love with him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Quick! Justice! Let the police be set after them!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IX.&mdash;&mdash;ORONTE, &Eacute;RASTE, JULIA, SBRIGANI.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julia</span>).
Come along; you shall come in spite of yourself. I
will put you in your father's hands. Sir, here is your daughter, whom
I had to take by force from the man with whom she was running away; it
is not for her sake that I did it, but entirely for yours. For, after
such conduct, I ought to despise her, and it is enough to cure me
altogether of my love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Ah! infamous girl that you are!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julia</span>).
How could you treat me in that way, after all the
proofs of affection I have given you? I do not blame you for being
obedient to your father's will; he is wise and judicious in all he
does; and I do not complain of him for having preferred another to me.
They told him that that other man was richer than I by four or five
thousand crowns, and four or five thousand crowns are a good round
sum, and are enough to make a gentleman break his word; but that you
should forget in a moment all the love I had for you, suffer yourself
to fall madly in love with the first new-comer, and shamefully follow
him; without the consent of your father, after all the crimes that
were charged upon him! It is what all the world will condemn, and what
my heart can never cease to reproach you with.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Well, yes; I fell in love with him, and I wanted to follow him,
since my father had chosen him to be my husband. Whatever you may say,
he is a very honest man, and all the crimes they accuse him of are so
many detestable falsehoods.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Be silent; you are an impertinent hussy, and I know better than
you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
They are some tricks they have played him, and
(<i>showing</i> <span class="smallcaps">&Eacute;raste</span>)
it is he himself, no doubt, who managed it all, to disgust you with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
What! I should be capable of such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
Yes, you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Be silent, I tell you. You are a silly girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
You need not think that I have any wish to prevent the match, and
that it is because I love you that I hastened to rescue you. I have
already told you that it is only because of the regard I have for your
father. I could not bear to see an honourable man exposed to the shame
of all the gossip that would be occasioned by such an action.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I am truly and sincerely obliged to you, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Farewell, Sir! I had the greatest desire to enter into your
family; I did everything to deserve such an honour; but I have been
unfortunate, and you did not judge me worthy of that honour. It will
not prevent me from retaining towards you all those feelings of esteem
and regard which your person demands; and although I cannot be your
son-in-law, I shall always be at your service.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Stay. Your behaviour touches my heart, and I give you my daughter
in marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
I won't have any other husband than Mr. de Pourceaugnac.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
And I will have you marry &Eacute;raste at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
No; I will not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I shall give it you about the ears.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
No, no, Sir; don't use violence towards her, I pray you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I will have her obey me, and I will show her that I am the
master.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Do you not see how fast in love she is with that man; and would
you have me possess the body while another has the heart?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
He has thrown some charm upon her. You may be sure that she will
change before long. Give me your hand. Come.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jul</span>.
No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
Ah! What, rebellion! Your hand, I tell you, at once. Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
Do not think that it is because of my love for you that I agree
to marry you; it is your father only I am in love with, and it is him
whom I marry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Oro</span>.
I am truly obliged to you, and I add ten thousand crowns to my
daughter's portion. Quick; a notary to draw up the contract.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Era</span>.
In the meanwhile, let us enjoy the pleasures of the season, and
fetch in those masks whom the report of Mr. de Pourceaugnac's wedding
has attracted hither.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
